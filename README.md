# Tools for Analytics Squirrel Census Project

## Introduction

Our goal is keeping track of  all the known squirrels and we started with Central Park.
Our project contains a view that shows a [map](https://yl4259.appspot.com/map) that displays the location of the squirrel sightings, a [view](https://yl4259.appspot.com/sightings) that lists all squirrel sightings with links to edit each, a view to update a particular sighting, a view to create a new sighting, and a view with general stats about the sightings.
